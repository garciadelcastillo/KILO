KILO, an Interactive Structural Analysis Tool for teaching.

This tool was developed in collaboration with Enrique de Justo, and was used in the Architecture School at University of Seville for many years to teach the fundamentals of structural behaviors in Structures I. The original project can be found here: http://personal.us.es/ejem/kilo/

The code dates back to 2010, the old days of Java-applets on the browser... and was the very first program I ever wrote after learning how to code with Processing :) It doesn't work anymore on the browser, so putting it up here with the hope I get some time soon to port it to p5.js :)
